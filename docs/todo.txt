unicode characters

The parser doesn't support unicode characters. The original reason was because it was not supported by the Alex lexer generator. However, it seems Alex does now support unicode, so this issue should be revisited:

pretty printer forces very long lines

The Pretty instances for the AST allow few newlines, especially in expressions. Why not use sep instead of hsep in the definition of commaList?

Parser fails at EOF without newline

parseStmt and parseModule fail when there is no newline at the end of input. This differs from the cpython behaviour:

Prelude Language.Python.Version2.Parser> parseStmt "print 42" ""
Left (UnexpectedToken (EOFToken {token_span = SpanEmpty}))
Even though the Python grammar in fact requires a newline, I think the cpython lexer implicitly inserts a newline at EOF when there is none. Also I think it would be nice at least for parseStmt to succeed (at the very least, it is at first quite hard to see why it fails)
