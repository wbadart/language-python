Testing
-------

How to test the parser? What to test for?

Idea: round trip parsing:

   parseAndPrint < test.py > out_1.py

It may not be the case that test.py == out_1.py, using string equality on the
contents of the python files. Even the ASTs might be different (eg
parenthesising, line numbers).

So we run printAndParse on the output:

   parseAndPrint < out_1.py > out_2.py

Hypothesis: out_1.py and out_2.py will be identical source files: we've
reached a fixed point. If they are not equal then there is a bug in either
the parser or the pretty printer or both.

Issues: this combines testing of the parser and pretty printer. It may
be desirable to test them in isolation - but is it worth the extra
effort?

It is harder to test the parser in isolation because its output is an
AST. Constructing expected ASTs is tedious, even for small programs.
